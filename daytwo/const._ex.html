        The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

        Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

        Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

        Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
        
        Use const when you declare:

            A new Array
            A new Object
            A new Function
            A new RegExp

        //PI = 5.14;      // This will give an error. It cannot be reassigned
        //PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error.It cannot be reassigned
        
        /**
        const age;

        // You can create a constant array:
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
        console.log("Before---"+cars)
        // You can change an element:
        cars[0] = "Toyota";
        console.log("After---"+cars)
        // You can add an element:
        cars.push("Audi");
        console.log("Pushed values---"+cars)
        //cars=15;
